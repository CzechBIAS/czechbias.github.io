# Welcome to CzechBIAS pages

The CzechBIAS is a freely formed society for anyone interested in BioImage Analysis, with the aim to associate BioImage Analysts so they can discuss and share experiences and tools. It was created in 2023 with the ideology of NEUBIAS and its successor in mind.

## Our goals:

* Provide space for Czech BioImage Analyst to exchange experience through online meetings.
* Provide safe space to discuss BioImage Analysis (BIAS) approaches, workflows, tools, ...
* Discuss and consider the possibility to provide "Letter of support for BIAS" from core facilities.
* Discuss and consider cooperative projects, workshops and other activities.
* Accumulate experience and needs of BIAS users (from core facilites and/or through collaborative projects).

## Is it for me?

Anyone interested in exchange of experience and/or having the desire to learn about BioImage Analysis is more than welcomed! Check the contact page or memeber part to learn about who we are and how to contact us.
