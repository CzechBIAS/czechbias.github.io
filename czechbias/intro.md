# Welcome to CzechBIAS pages

The Czech BioImage Analystsâ€™ Society (**CzechBIAS**) is a freely formed society for anyone interested in BioImage Analysis. Its aim is to associate BioImage Analysts so they can discuss and share experiences and tools. It was created in 2023 with the ideology of [GloBIAS](https://www.globias.org/) and [NEUBIAS](https://eubias.org/NEUBIAS/) and its successor in mind, and [SwissBIAS](https://swissbias.github.io/) as an inspiration.

This is a community effort driven by all members, with flexible degrees of involvement: If there is something you would like to see done, the fastest way may well be to just do it.

## Why we exist:

* Provide space for Czech BioImage Analysts to exchange experience through online meetings.
* Provide a space to discuss BioImage Analysis (BIAS) approaches, workflows, and tools, ...
* Discuss, share, and consider cooperative projects, workshops, lectures, and other activities.
* Accumulate the experience and needs of BIAS users (from core facilities and/or through collaborative projects).
* Define the role of bioimage analysts.
* Track and promote workshops, courses, and events for our members and anyone interested.
